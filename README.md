# Pokémon API Project

## Homepage
The homepage features a carousel displaying images of popular Pokémon. Below the carousel, there are two cards depicting the other functions of the project:

1. **Search for Pokémon**
   - Includes a link to the Pokémon search page.
   
2. **Get Info on Pokémon**
   - Includes a link to the Pokémon information page.

## Pokémon Search Page
The Pokémon search page allows the user to search for Pokémon by either name or ID number. Once entered, a card will appear with the following details:
- Pokémon Name
- Original Image of the Pokémon
- Pokémon ID

Users can search for as many Pokémon as they like, and the cards will accumulate on the page until it is refreshed.

## Pokémon Info Page
The Pokémon info page allows the user to search for Pokémon by either name or ID number. Once a search is entered and a Pokémon is found, a card will appear on the page with the following details:
- Pokémon Name
- Pokémon Image
- Height of the Pokémon
- Main Move
- Any inherent held items (if the Pokémon has no inherent held items, this field will be empty)
